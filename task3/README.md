Data Preparation for Machine Learning  
Contributors: David & Anissa

Objective
Prepare data from SQL and MongoDB for machine learning model training.

Key Steps
- Clean data (handle missing values, convert types)
- Feature engineering (categorical encoding)
- Split data and train a Random Forest Regressor
- Export predictions and model

Files
- `Car_Price_Prediction_Notebook.ipynb`: Full workflow in notebook form
- `automobile_data.csv`: Dataset used for training
- `predictions.csv`: Predictions made by the model
- `random_forest_car_price_model.pkl`: Saved trained model



How to Run

Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Deolinda1506/Databases_Prediction_Pipeline_G4.git
   cd Databases_Prediction_Pipeline_G4
